## Full Summary

Outside blows cold air, while the White family sits near the fireplace, staying in the warmth. Mr. White and Herbert are playing chess, and Mrs. White is knitting. Mr. White constantly worries about when his visitor would come to his faraway house. Herbert, on the other hand, is too focused on playing chess. Then, Mr. White spots his visitor and runs to greet him. The friend of Mr. White is Sergeant-Major Morris.

During the conversation with Morris, Mr. White asks about the monkey’s paw. Then, Morris explains about the mysterious and magical little paw. He brings it up, and Herbert takes a look. Morris adds that the paw will give three wishes to three different men and that the old fakir has spelled the paw. The White family is curious to know if it is real but laughs as they think this is a made-up story. Morris is solemn and tells the listeners his story. The two men’s wishes, including Morris, came true. The first man’s three wishes all came true, but he used the third wish for his death, which is how Morris got it. Morris wants to burn it; however, Mr. White gets the paw. Then, Morris tells him that if he really wants to make a wish, [he should] ask for a sensible wish.

To test if the paw is magical, the family thinks about their first wish. They know they have nothing to wish for, but Herbert insists on two hundred pounds to pay their mortgage loan. The father agrees, and he makes a wish. Suddenly, the paw moves in his hand, which creeps the old man, but there is no sight of the money. Herbert stares at the monkey’s paw with amazement and goes to sleep.

The next day, the White family joke about the monkey’s paw since there is no appearance of the two hundred pounds. Then, Herbert goes to his work. During the day, Mr. and Mrs. White see a man wearing expensive-looking silk clothes. He decides to knock on the house, and Mrs. White lets him in. The man from Herbert’s workplace has come to tell them the bad news; that Herbert was caught in the machinery. The man gives Mr. and Mrs. White two hundred pounds for the loss. The old woman screams as she notices it is exactly two hundred pounds like they have wished.

The night feels empty without Herbert. Mr. and Mrs. White are tired as the days pass. Then, Mrs. White thinks about making another wish. She convinces Mr. White to use the remainder of the two wishes to get their son back to life. Mr. White feels suspicious and warns Mrs. White not to use it because there will be a consequence. However, feeling the absence of their son, Mrs. White insists on making the wish. They make their second wish, for their son to return.

The night is long, and the old couple give up on reuniting with their son. Suddenly, they hear a loud knock on the door that echoes throughout the whole house. Mrs. White, who thinks it must be Herbert outside, jumps out to open the door with excitement. But Mr. White pulls Mrs. White from answering the door. The old woman is desperate to see her son. Wanting to open the top lock that will perhaps lead the family back to their normal life, [she begs Mr. White to unlock the lock. He finds the monkey’s paw and makes his last wish through the harsh sounds of his breath: a wish that stops the loud knock, disappoints and pains his wife, but a wish where he can see the quiet deserted road with street lights like before.

## My Thoughts

The author chose to write about fakir putting on a spell so that three different people can wish for three wishes. I think this was intentional. It surprised me that all three men, including Mr. White, used all their three wishes. They made their first wish out of curiosity, but as a result, they walked into a trap. It is interesting to note how three wishes are used so people can have a way to use the last wish to get out from the horrifying unanticipated consequence. I can guess that three men had not-so-great experience with the monkey’s paw. They faced consequences when they received their wishes. So, the first man decided to die for the last wish; Morris decided to burn it; and, Mr. White lost his son forever.

“The Monkey’s Paw” also teaches us that we should think for our wishes, and it shows the consequences of greed. Morris, who already used his three wishes, tells the White family to make a sensible wish. “Sensible wish” means a wish where it does not intermingle with greed. So, since the White family wished for money for their first wish, they began to face consequences. The book also shows the danger if we follow our curiosity just too far.

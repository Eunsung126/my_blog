## Full Summary

This story takes place in Maycomb, Alabama. A girl narrating the story and also starring herself in the book is Scout. She first talks about herself, her brother who recently broke his arm, and her new friend, Dill, a boy from Mississippi. She is a six year old who has the excitedness and the eagerness of going to school in September. Her dad, Atticus, is a kind lawyer and protects his children. Scout grows up mostly in care of her housekeeper, Calpurnia. Like other kids in Maycomb, Scout and Jem are always curious about their neighbor, Boo Radley. They have wanted to see Boo because there are many rumors about unknown Boo, who never comes out from his house. They believe that he is a monster until they gather the bravery to arouse Boo out his house with the help of their friend, Dill. Jem begins to write a letter to Boo, but their plans get ruined as Atticus finds out. Atticus warns kids not to bother Boo; however, kids are even more obsessed with discovering Boo’s identity. One night, kids transpass Boo’s yard, and Boo’s brother shoots at the yard because of the noises that the children have made. The town becomes a bit flustered, yet the village settles peacefully again.

Even though Scout had been excited to go to school, after the first day, she changes her mind because she gets in trouble. There are two main reasons: one, Scout can read and her teacher thinks that she was taught incorrectly; second, Scout tells her teacher about her classmate, Walter, that he cannot pay the lunch money since he is poor. Therefore, Scout wants Atticus to teach her. Soon, winter comes and a neighbor's house gets caught in the fire. When Jem and Scout are waiting outside, a man covers Scout with a blanket. Soon, the kids wonder who gave them the blanket, and of course, Atticus says it was Boo Radley. Then, the story jumps into Atticus defending a black man, Tom Robinson, who is stated to have hit a white woman. As the town goes once again crazy because Atticus is defending for a black individual, many people berate Atticus as a “nigger-lover”. The town is so into making statements about Atticus that even Scout and Jem hear about this. The court is filled with people, including the judge, who discriminate against Tom based on his ethnicity. Even Scout, Jem and Dill come to see. The case is about whether or not Tom hit and raped Mayella. Tom states exactly what happened on that night. Tom comes to help Mayella do housework. Mayella tries to kiss Tom, but her dad, Ewell, walks in on them. Then, Tom runs away. Mayella and her dad try to prove that Tom hit her below her right eye, but Atticus and Tom defend that Tom cannot use his left arm. Even though all the evidence proves that Tom is innocent, only because Tom is black, the judge states that Tom is found guilty. One day, the town goes icy when they hear that Tom is killed during his escape by the prison guards. And there is a rumor about Ewell’s revenge on Atticus.

Everything moves quickly as Halloween comes. Scout decides to be a ham and walk to a Halloween party with Jem. After the party, Scout and Jem walk slowly on the spooky road. Jem is constantly hearing noises coming from bushes. Sensing danger, he screams, “Run”. However, running with a ham costume was not easy for Scout. Scout falls to the ground and that's when someone grabs Jem. Scout doesn’t know what is happening to Jem as she can only hear his screams. Suddenly, Scout feels that someone is holding her and saves Jem. They return to their house, and Scout finally realizes that the person who saved her was Boo Radley. The sheriff, Tate, decides to close the case as an incident where Ewell fell on his own knife in order to protect Boo Radley from public attention. The novel ends with Atticus taking care of Jem’s bitten arm, and Scout truly understanding what her father meant by, “It’s sin to kill a mockingbird.”

## Reflection

If I pick a memorable quote in this book, it would be:
“Atticus said to Jem one day, ‘I’d rather you shoot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know you'll go after birds. Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.’
That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it.
'Your father's right,' she said. 'Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corncribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.'" (119)
In this book, the mockingbird represents the innocence of Tom Robinson and Boo Radley.

**Take-Away Lessons from _To Kill A Mockingbird_**

1. I knew that everyone has narrow thinking because of his or her skin color, culture, and religion. In the book, most white people didn’t believe Tom. I once more realized the reality of prejudice and racism from this book. Over the news, especially during the first few months of Covid-19, I saw and heard many non-Asian people’s racist behaviours against Asian people online. All videos and these acts were unacceptable and inappropriate. During the pandemic, as an Asian, I was asked, “Do you eat dogs?” I was very confused about the people’s intentions of asking such questions, and therefore, I just said “No.” But _To Kill A Mockingbird_ brought me here to face these discriminatory questions again. Even though I wish I would never hear such insensitive remarks anymore, if I was asked again, I would tell them, “What kind of decisions I make or what I like should not be based on my nationality, my culture, and my skin color. The only fact that I am Asian does not represent my thoughts, feelings, and behaviours.”
2. Through _To Kill A Mockingbird_, I learned that having an influential person or having relationships with people who have clear minds can help me. In the book, a wise man, Atticus, teaches his children that racism is sort of a disease and most people go crazy when it is brought up. So, I predicted that this disease is easy to have as we see so many people with this “disease” in Maycomb. I also saw that the town was on to Tom Robinson’s case with unreasonable obsessions. I think Atticus describing racism is unexpected because I can connect so many real world problems to Atticus’s words. There is another reason I think being close to a wise person is important. Atticus was one of the few white people who didn’t have the “disease” in Maycomb. Due to this, he got a bad reputation, and his children heard their father being called a “nigger lover.” Instead of denying, he repeats his meaningful lesson to Scout:
   “‘Do you defend niggers, Atticus?’ I asked him that evening.
   ‘Of course I do. Don’t say nigger, Scout. That’s common.’
   ‘‘s what everybody at school says.’’
   In this dialogue, Atticus tried to teach Scout not to follow the crowd, but instead to be mindful of her words.

## Historical Context

To Kill A Mockingbird was written by Harper Lee in 1960. This novel takes place in the Southern state of America, Alabama in the mid 1930s, where many white people were racist towards black people. This is why the town is polarized as a white or black community, where they have clashing thoughts.

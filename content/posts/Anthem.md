# Anthem

“It is a sin to write this. It is sin to think words no others think and
put them down upon a paper no others are to see.”

We live in a society that has changed over thousands of years. In a contemporary world, we cannot even imagine being unable to write our thoughts or discuss our opinions. In a dystopian future imagined by Ayn Rand, people have to conform to a rule that benefits only the collectives of the society. Living in a society where fences are drawn out clear, Equality 7-2521, makes decisions that are out of the boundaries.

## Characters

All characters are named based on words necessary for society, but in the book, the names reflect that all citizens are the same without a hint of individualism.

- Equality 7-2521: An individual who has a clear and intelligent mind and develops a creation. However, he faces troubles in his dystopian society because he is “different” from his fellow peers.
- Liberty 5-3000: A young woman who falls in love with Equality 7-2521. She leaves her society to follow Equality’s brave path.
- International 4-8818: Humorous friend of Equality 7-2521. His dream of being an artist is shattered as he is assigned as the street sweeper like Equality 7-2521.
- Collective 0-0009: The “oldest and wisest” of the Council in the society.

## Full Summary

A young man, Equality 7-2521, spends time alone in a tunnel to write. He knows that he is not supposed to write his thoughts by the laws of his society. He does not feel guilty about his acts, although in his mind, he constantly begs for the forgiveness of the ruling Council for breaking their rule. We see his childhood story and from that, we know his job. Equality 7-2521 wishes to be a scholar, but he is unhappy in the Home of Students. Having an advantage, being smart and quick is a curse. Therefore, the Council of Vocations assigns him to be a street sweeper. He meets International 4-8818, and they hide in the tunnel for discovery. They conduct experiments and discover electricity. They build a lightbulb and decide they should share their findings with the world. Meanwhile, he meets the Golden One, Liberty 5-3000 as he sweeps the streets. He quickly falls in love with Liberty 5-3000, a peaceful and calm girl. Even though it is wrong to speak to her according to the law, he still speaks to her, and both end up liking each other.

However, his good days do not last long. Soon, he is unable to write for 30 days because he has been caught. Equality 7-2521 forgets to do his responsibilities and goes to the Home of Street Sweepers. He gets suspicions by other workers since he did not answer the question from the oldest. Therefore, he is sent to the Palace of Corrective Detention. When the judge asks the same question repeatedly, he only thinks of the lightbulb and breaks out from the Palace of Corrective Detention.

Then, Equality 7-2521 goes and shows his brothers and to Collective 0-0009 about his invention. Everyone is angry and threatens that Equality 7-2521 should be killed with his lightbulb. Equality 7-2521 is also angry at the fact that everyone is unitedly scolding him for his actions. So, he escapes the city and settles down as he gets to the Uncharted Forest. There, he is free. A few days later, Equality 7-2521 hears a sound from the bushes. He gets frightened, but soon is happy as he sees the Golden One. They find the word “I”, change their names, and know the meaning and the glory of the word, ego.

## Themes Connection With _The Giver_

**The Giver**

Before jumping into a book, I always preview settings and characters on student friendly websites as a backup in case I have trouble comprehending. This practice helps me to understand complex, detailed books, like Anthem. When I was diving in Anthem, it reminded me of a similar book I have read in the past, “The Giver” by Lois’ Lowry. This book also takes place in a dystopian world where all characters have to obey the restrictive laws. While growing up in a community where everything is organized and clean, one of the citizens as well as the protagonist, Jonas, gets selected to be the Receiver of Memory. Being the Receiver of Memory, Jonas learns all the secrets his society is hiding from their citizens. Through his painful job, he collects new information that makes him have the opposite point of view of his community. He now wants to leave his impassive, colourless, dangerous, and double-sided artificial society.

**Backgrounds of Ayn Rand and Lois Lowry**

Both writers discuss difficult topics such as wars, racism, and collectivism. Two authors have difficult past memories and experiences that they cannot forget. These past memories eventually gave two authors ideas to write two medal winning novels.

Starting with Lois Lowry, she went through many times of sad experiences that happened to her family members. She experiences deep loss of loved ones: her father’s memory loss and her sister’s death. Her father's memory loss made Lois Lowry imagine a world in The Giver. During National Public Radio Author Interviews, Lowry shared her experience of showing an image of her sister, who died at the age of 28 due to cancer, to her father. When her father asked Lowry about her sister, Lowry had to explain about her sister’s death. So, Lowry imagined if the world would be better without memories, and that’s when she began to think of writing a book about people who manipulate human memories, especially the painful ones.

Ayn Rand also had a sorrowful past. She was the eldest daughter of her Russian-Jewish family. She was raised under her father, Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum, who was a successful pharmacist, and her mother, Anna Borisovna. She was excellent in her academics and taught herself how to read and write. In February 1917, the Russian Revolution happened and the Bolshevik Revolution also occurred later. In order to escape the dangerous situation, her family moved to Crimea. However, due to the Russian Revolution of 1917, her father’s pharmacy was taken by the communist authorities, which caused Rand’s family to go near-starvation. These situations deeply troubled Ayn Rand. After experiencing painful memories, she moved to the United States, studied as a screenwriter, and became an American citizen in 1931.

**Connections Between _Anthem_ and _The Giver_**

1. Both authors show disapproval for highly-regulated societies where citizens are strictly restricted in what they do privately and publicly.
2. The settings of both books take place in the anti-utopian communities. Ayn Rand and Lois Lowry depict the communities as being secretive, limiting, and controlling. I think they both have the same negative opinions about highly regulated societies since their main characters try to escape the anti-utopian world despite the danger.
   A gap between people who have power and people who do not have power. Both books contrast mistreatment of the people who have less power when compared to the people who have maximum power. Two books have a collective or elders who have the most power and control over the communities. This was especially seen in The Giver, when the primary elder can watch the life of every citizen. In Anthem, Collective 0-0009 hates Equality 7-2521 for not being respectful to the rules. Collective 0-0009 values the decisions that are only made by the council, which evidently proves that Collective 0-0009 shows respect to only those who have power. On the other hand, most of the citizens in The Giver have no power. All citizens are assigned to their jobs and have no power to change anything or share their opinions in the society. In the book, there was no election, votes for rights, or public space to share citizens’ voices. Similarly, public opinions are not shared in Anthem, and we see that people without power are being treated unfairly. Equality 7-2521, who is a street sweeper, gets mistreated when the students in the Home of Scholar laughed about a street sweeper coming to show an invention.
3. In the end, the two protagonists decide to run away from their community. After two protagonists experience real evil and discover the truth of their communities, they are propelled by their strong emotion to flee their communities.
4. Unfair treatments and biases exist in the stories and in our world. Imagining myself in a dystopian world like Anthem and The Giver, I realized that I must be “ordinary” and be no different compared to fellow citizens. However, to have individualism, the world offers a bit of flavour. Sometimes, this little drop of flavour can be sweet and bitter. In Anthem, Equality 7-2521 has an extra functionable brain when compared to his brothers.
   Similarly, Jonas from The Giver has unusual eye color and is able to see colors unlike his peers. However, the protagonists’ differences from the others in the dystopian world cause internal and external conflict.
   In our world, when we experience unfamiliar culture or see unconventional appearances that catch our eyes, we can’t ignore, but to look at it. This is the similarity of our world to a dystopian world; that everyone is different. Anyone who is extra-ordinary, he or she will catch people’s attention whether it is wanted or unwanted.

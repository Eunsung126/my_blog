## Full Summary

During one misty evening in November 2053, a man steps into the streets in the city of silence. It is eight o’clock. The streets see the man, Leonard Mead, who loves to interact with sidewalks. He walks alone under the moonlight, with his hands in his pockets.

This is a place where 3 million people live. Possibly, it might be the suitable place for many. Mr. Leonard Mead sees the same houses with dark windows on every street he walks by. Inside, he hears whispers and mummers. Due to the fact that the streets are so quiet, he wears snickers just to reduce the noise. So that he will not face the dogs that would bark at him. Mr. Leonard Mead whispers to every house where people are watching TV. But, no one replies to him.

He came to a cloverleaf intersection. During the day, it would be a busy street with cars like how the groups of ants buzz when delivering giant food back to their home. During the night, it’s the opposite.

Then, he hears a sharp voice that breaks the silence and pauses his walk. The flashlight stings Mr. Leonard Mead’s eyes. It is the only police car that is left in the city. Crime makes no sense in this community, so there is no need for multiple police cars. The police order Mr. Leonard Mead to stop and raise his hands. The police ask questions, and the conversation ends with the police arresting him after he said he likes walking during the night. Inside, he smells riveted steel and sees no one in the front seat. There is only a speaker. The police said they will take him to the Psychiatric Center for Research on Regressive Tendencies. They pass one house with all lights on that is spotlighted in contrast to unlit homes, and Mr. Leonard Mead immediately comments that it is his house. But he hears no answer. The car drives away, leaving the empty streets alone. The streets face disappearance of the small, but meaningful, footsteps on “buckling concrete walk”, “grassy seams”, and “silent and long and empty” streets.

## Analysis

The city is placed in 2053, where the world is so developed that people are already adapted to the world that they are living in and have no ways to go back to the ways of life in the past when people were not entirely replaced by automation or technology. The highly advanced world shows that there is no space for a person to display their differences. Mr. Leonard Mead is arrested for walking on the streets at night, simply because he is the lone pedestrian in the city. This shows that the town is in a tight frame, but 99.99% of the people are already adapted to it. The 0.01%, who is Mr. Leonard Mead, has no space to have his rights. On the other hand, it shows how strong a community might be if everyone bonds together. The Pedestrian teaches the importance for a community to have balance on a person's rights and the community’s power.

I think this city might somewhat be similar to the world that we might live in the future. The city is overwhelmingly dependent on technology. The city is all programmed, even the police. This leads into a place with no emotions, in simpler terms, a dystopian world. I was shocked that the police, which was systematized by technology, had more power than humans. In the short story, technology is more important than one human. The police are programmed by humans, but the programmed technology is ruling the world. Since technology is like a “king or queen” in the city, we see no emotions. Even the people, who can express their feelings, are staring at the TV screen like zombies. Also, the police usually have to say the reason why they are arresting someone in the real world. But, in the book, we don't see that. This all shows that there are no questions about the procedures of technology, but only adaptation.

## Full Summary

The narrator explains about the town of Omelas and the people living there. The city is nearly perfect with non-stop happiness, where its residents enjoy highly advanced technology, culture, and wealth. Omelas has no kings, no swords, nor slaves. Most importantly, everyone is full of delight like being told by the narrator. It can be an unrivaled city if the narrator didn’t tell the readers about the child. Everyone’s happiness depends on one child’s suffering. This child lives in dirt covered with “its own excrement continually” (p. 4). The young innocent child experiences the coldness, the hunger, and all the abuse. The child lives in terrible condition, the condition opposite from everyone in Omelas. When citizens are revealed the truth of the child’s suffering, many of them are shocked. However, they soon realize that just one injustice saves all the happiness of the rest of the city, so they decide to stay in Omelas. But some are different. Those people do not accept one injustice, therefore, they walk away from Omelas. None know where they are going. They are going to a place that is “less imaginable to most of us than the city of happiness” or perhaps this place doesn’t exist. They seem to go to a different place, nonetheless, the ones who walk away from Omelas.

## Reflection

**Brings Up The Trolley Problem**

“Would you kill one person to save a greater number of people?” This is a hypothetical moral dilemma, known as ‘The Trolley Problem’, conceived by the philosopher, Philippa Foot, in 1967.

Imagine you are watching a runaway trolley barreling down the tracks straight towards five people who are strapped to the tracks. You have a lever in front of you that will lead the trolley to go the other direction. If you pull the lever, the trolley will pass through a track where there is only one person. So, the problem is, “Would you pull the lever?” This problem still comes up today, and we still think about what would be the best way. According to a BBC survey and other studies, about 80% to 90% people would pull the lever.

Pulling the lever to sacrifice the one would be the utilitarian model, producing a greater overall good for the greater number of people. Since this decision brings the most good to the most people, people of Omelas choose to live with. Let’s go back to ‘The Trolley Problem’, change some parameters, and think why some people of Omelas decided to leave the city. So, what if the five are innocent bystanders, and one person was your mother? Or what if one person was an innocent bystander, but five others were convicted murderers? When we pull up emotions into the problem, the answer determined by the greatest good for a greater number doesn’t seem to be easy to follow. I think the main reason other than they do not agree with one injustice is because of their emotions and feelings for the child.

People of Omelas decided to trade one innocent child’s sorrow for their own happiness. However, the ones who walk away from Omelas seem to reject an utopian moral of happiness made by the suffering of the innocent.

The Trolley Problem also introduced in the Harvard classes, Justice: What's The Right Thing To Do? Episode 01 "THE MORAL SIDE OF MURDER" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBdfcR-8hEY&ab_channel=HarvardUniversity

**3 Questions I Want to Ask**

1. **To Omelas:** How is this child chosen to be sacrificed?

I think people would wonder, “What made Omelas to choose this particular child to be tortured?” Every act is made because of reasons. We don’t usually choose something important without a reason. If I have a chance to ask a question to Omelas, it would be interesting to hear the reason behind choosing this child.

2. **To Child:** Were you forced or volunteered to be the one innocent?

This question somehow relates to the question above on how the child was selected? Although I think this child was forced into it, I want to know the real answer to this question from the child. And when I hear this answer, I would make sure that the child and I are in a safe space, where the child feels safe enough to reveal his or her feelings.

3. **To The Ones Who Walked Away:** As a person who left the city, if you had the option of taking the child with you, would you leave the City of Omelas together? And if you bring the child, would you take on the consequence for your decision?

Although we mostly see two main options, to leave or stay in Omelas, I would like to add one more additional option, to bring the child when leaving. The ones who walked away left Omelas, but they also left the child; They rejected the utilitarian choice, but they did not break the utilitarian choice Omelas made.

So, the more critical question would be, “Would you bring the child?” By saving the child, the utilitarian model, the greatest good for a greater number of people, would be defeated. The whole system would disappear. And eventually, it will bring negative emotions and thoughts to the whole people in Omelas, including your families and friends. So, if this decision has been made, which would change everything, would you be responsible for it?

**What Could Be “The Place The Ones Who Walk Away” Went?**

From my prediction, I think readers are not supposed to know where these people go. There are thousands of ways where these people could have gone. They might go find a place that tries harder to solve injustices, or go to a place where there is suffering and happiness, or just walk until their feets cannot move and lay down. Even though it’s unclear where they could have gone, from knowing that they rejected the unfair living of the child, I think they have a clear mind, that they decline a utopian happiness founded by the sacrifice of someone.

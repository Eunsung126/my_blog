## Full Summary

We are introduced to an older man named Santiago, a Cuban fisherman. Unfortunately, he hasn’t caught a fish for 84 days. However, even without good results, he still goes to the sea daily with his apprentice, Manolin. One day Manolin stops sailing with Santiago because Manolin thinks Santiago is unlucky, and Manolin’s parents decide to send him to a different boat. Even though Manolin left Santiago, he takes care of Santiago by bringing food.

The old man tells Manolin he will be sailing to the Gulf Stream. Of course, the boy does not go with him, so Santiago leaves alone. This is where the journey takes place for three days.

By noon, Santiago is confident that a giant marlin has caught his bait. However, since it is enormous, he is dragged by the marlin and fails to bring the fish on the board. In the face of such hardship, he starts to respect the marlin and even refers to the fish as a brother. Santiago fights against hunger and thirst for two days while suffering from hand cramps. The limits of his mentality is reached.

The fish begins to circle his boat on the third day. Then, suddenly, he is surprised by how enormous it is. Santiago uses all his remaining strength to yank it to one side and stab it with a harpoon. He fixes the fish to a spot in the boat and gets ready to head back home. He initially feels horrible for the murder of his brother, but as soon as he imagines the price he can get for it and the large number of people he can feed, his desire for money overcomes him.

However, going back home was not easy. The blood from the marlin draws a few mako sharks. He uses his harpoon to kill one but is unlucky; he misplaces it. Then, he makes a new weapon by attaching his knife to one end of his oar. Santiago finally manages to kill the crew of sharks, even though his marlin has already been consumed. Santiago believes that the sharks stole his dreams and defeated him while seeing the remaining components of the marlin.

The marlin and the boat are left on the shore after the older man finally makes it to the shore. Feeling exhausted, he makes his way home. Then he drifts off to sleep soundly. The next day, a crowd of fishermen, tourists, and villagers surround Santiago’s boat and are amazed. They estimate the fish’s bones to be eighteen feet long. They also make the boy go to Santiago because they fear he might be in pain. Manolin discovers the older man sleeping and worries about him as he sees Santiago’s hands.

When the old man finally awakes, Manolin gives him some coffee and newspapers. The fish head is offered to Pedrico. Manolin and Santiago agree that they should go sailing and fishing again. The story ends with the old man dreaming about lions on an African beach.

## Analysis

While reading this book, the idea of, “You need the courage to start anything, but you need more effort not to give up," reminded me through Santiago.

Santiago is a hard-working and courageous person. This can be shown in the book in several ways. We can see he did not give up in the middle of his 84 misfortune days or when his hand was covered with pain while catching the giant marlin. I think Santiago was brave to become a fisherman. Since we know he is an older man, we can predict that he has been fishing for a long time without giving up. It might have taken Santiago lots of thought to start fishing, but even though he experienced lots of trouble from fishing, he didn’t give up. Since he did not give up, he was able to face a giant marlin, and he learnt from the fish.

We all are interested in something, whether it’s a hobby, project or skill, most of us begin at a certain point. But not many people finish and do it for a long time. We can learn from the older man that we must not give up and do what we need to do with courage. _The Old Man and the Sea_ teaches us the lesson to keep going even if we face difficulties.

**The Life of Santiago and Ernest Hemingway**

1. Hemingway integrates his work ritual of starting early into his own character; Santiago also rises early before sunrise to go fishing. In the interview with Hemingway in 1958, he said, “When I am working on a book or a story I write every morning as soon after first light as possible.” This is similar to Santiago because he starts fishing while seeing the sun rise. I think Santiago’s character is drawn from Hemingway. In the book, Santiago said the same point that Hemingway once stated in the interview. Hemingway stated, “There is no one to disturb you and it is cool or cold and you come to your work and warm as you write” (Plimpton, 1958). This is parallel to Santiago who felt, “He was shivering with the morning cold. But he knew he would shiver himself warm and that soon he would be rowing” (Hemingway, 1952, p. 9). They both start from morning cold, but they get warm physically and emotionally by doing what they need to do.

2. Hemingway is organized and follows his principles. I would describe Hemingway as a well. Instead of getting all the inspiration in the well at once and waiting for it to be refilled, he thinks it is better to set the amount of inspiration and get that amount everyday. In fact, he writes about 500 words each day. According to the book, Santiago never took a day off. 84 days with no fish non-stop. He does not stop finishing in the middle of his 84 misfortunate days because he is living his life as a fisherman. He also does not give a range of numbers of fish he needs to catch. For example, he did not say, “I am going to catch 10 fish tomorrow,” or “I am going to fish next week since there are no fish this week and maybe there will be some next week!” Their mindsets for doing work are similar. Instead of waiting for fish to reappear or not going to the sea at all for periods of time, Santiago still goes to the ocean. This shows that both Hemingway and Santiago are self-disciplined.

3. Marlin represents a challenging world a person needs to face. Anyone needs to destroy a world by themself so they can be established or be born in a new way. Santiago does not give up when he fights to create his world. This shows that he does not easily give up. Hemingway nearly gave up his dreams of becoming a famous novelist. In the end, Santiago and Hemingway both did not give up and established their own world to guide us to go further like them.
